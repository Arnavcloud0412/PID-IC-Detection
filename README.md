# 🚀 PID-IC-Detection  

A powerful AI-driven project for **pipeline and I&C detection** in P&ID drawings. Built with **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit**.  

---

## 📌 About the Project  
**PID-IC-Detection** is an **AI-powered system** designed to analyze **Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID)** and automatically detect:  
✅ **Pipeline elements**  
✅ **Instrumentation & Control (I&C) connections**  
✅ **Segment associations**  

This project leverages **deep learning** and **computer vision** to automate the identification and labeling process, making P&ID analysis faster and more efficient.
